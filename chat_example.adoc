With http://grooscript.org[grooscript], you can create groovy code and run it in your browser or
http://nodejs.org/[Node.js]. Let's see an example using a groovy dsl in the server, groovy templates,
http://socket.io/[socket.io], and more groovy code in the client. Is just a chat application, clients login
the chat, write messages and see messages from other logged users.

=== Server side

The server is a node.js app, starting a web server with http://expressjs.com/[express], and websocket server
with socket.io. To run all this you need Node.js installed, grooscript, express and socket.io
https://www.npmjs.org/[npm modules]. The server just serves +index.html+ page and process chat commands comming
from websockets. I have created a groovy dsl to start the server:

[source,groovy]
--
include::src/main/groovy/startServer.groovy[]
--

=== Groovy templates

I have created a little helper, in the grooscript gradle plugin, to process groovy templates. Is a incubating
feature, with some limitations, that dunno if people is interested in use it. At the moment, only available
in snapshot version.

[source,groovy]
--
task chatTemplates(type: org.grooscript.gradle.TemplatesTask) {
    templatesPath = 'src/main/webapp/templates'
    templates = ['join.gtpl', 'left.gtpl', 'message.gtpl', 'index.gtpl']
    destinationPath = 'src/main/webapp/js'
}
--

The templates are converted to javascript and added to a file called +gstemplates.js+, that file has a class
that you can use in javascript, you can use in javascript / groovy:

[source,groovy]
--
Templates.applyTemplate('join.gtpl', [name: data.name])
--

Index template is used in the server, the rest are used in the browser, to use with the messages coming
from websocket. Is very easy create logic in a groovy template, for example to show messages
from a pirate user:

[source,groovy]
--
include::src/main/webapp/templates/message.gtpl[]
--

=== Client side

The index page is a groovy template coming from the server:

[source,groovy]
--
include::src/main/webapp/templates/index.gtpl[]
--

Jquery, grooscript, grooscript-tools, templates, socket.io are the libraries needed. The logic of the
application running in the browser is in +Client.groovy+. Just with +Client.init()+ starts all in the browser:

[source,groovy]
--
include::src/main/groovy/chat/Client.groovy[]
--

Lot of things are done in the client, send the login, switching views between chat mode and login mode,
receive login from other users, show messages from other users, disconnected users, init sockets client and
listeners,... As you can see, all logic is in one groovy file.

=== Run all

To run this, created +startChat.js+ file, only have to do +node startChat.js+ to run the server:

[source,javascript]
--
include::startChat.js[]
--

Now open your browser in +http://localhost:3000/+ and the login div appears.

All the code is on https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-demos[github]. I use some snapshots from grooscript
and grooscript gradle plugin, with grooscript 0.6.2 and gradle plugin 0.7 all will be updated and will work
if you clone it.

=== Conclusion

Is very easy create logic in groovy and see the results in the browser. Was very funny explore socket.io
and groovy templates with grooscript. Groovy is better language than javascript, and if you know groovy you
can create better code running in js world.

Please, if you have comments, suggestions, problems,... don't hesitate to contact me at grooscript@gmail.com, or open
an issue or feature in http://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript/issues?state=open[Github]. More guides come in the
future, also can find more documentation in http://grooscript.org[grooscript] site.
